This Python program simulates a simple slot machine game. Here's a brief description:

The player starts by depositing an initial amount of money.
The player can choose the number of lines to bet on (up to a maximum of 3).
The player then places a bet on each line (between 1 and 100 dollars).
The slot machine generates a random 3x3 grid of symbols (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D') for each line.
If the symbols on a line match, the player wins a prize based on the bet amount.
The player can spin the slot machine multiple times until they run out of money or choose to quit.
The program includes functions for depositing money, selecting the number of lines to bet on, placing bets, generating random symbol grids, calculating winnings, and displaying the slot machine grid. It also ensures that the player cannot bet more money than they have.

Overall, this program provides a simple and interactive way to play a basic slot machine game in the console.
